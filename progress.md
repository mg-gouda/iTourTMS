## Finance Phase 1: Foundation & Configuration (Completed)
- **Date:** 2026-02-23
- **Commit:** `e0048af` — feat(finance): implement Phase 1 — foundation & configuration
- **Scope:** 36 files, 4,523 lines

### Prisma Schema
- 7 enums: AccountType (18 values), JournalType (6), TaxUse (3), TaxAmountType (4), TaxScope (2), TaxDocType (2), TermValueType (3), DelayType (3)
- 9 models: AccountGroup, AccountTag, FinAccount, Journal, TaxGroup, Tax, TaxRepartitionLine, PaymentTerm, PaymentTermLine
- Renamed Auth.js `Account` → `AuthAccount` with `@@map("Account")`

### tRPC Routers
- `finance.account.*` — CRUD + groups + tags, cursor pagination, search/filter
- `finance.journal.*` — CRUD with type filtering
- `finance.tax.*` — CRUD with nested repartition lines + groups CRUD
- `finance.paymentTerm.*` — CRUD with nested lines + computeDueDates

### Services
- `tax-computation.ts` — PERCENT/FIXED/DIVISION, price-included, cascading (Decimal.js)
- `payment-term-calculator.ts` — installment schedules, 3 delay types (date-fns)
- `sequence-generator.ts` — document numbering with yearly/monthly reset

### UI Pages (14 pages)
- Chart of Accounts: list, create, edit
- Journals: list, create, edit
- Taxes: list, create, edit (with repartition lines)
- Tax Groups: list with inline dialog
- Payment Terms: list, create, edit (with installment lines)

### Shared Components
- `DataTable` — @tanstack/react-table: sorting, filtering, pagination
- `MonetaryField` — currency-aware amount input

### Seed Data
- 45 accounts, 5 groups, 6 journals, 2 taxes (VAT 14%), 4 payment terms
- 17 permissions, 2 roles (finance_manager, finance_accountant)

### Key Decisions
- `FinAccount` naming to avoid Auth.js collision (mapped to `fin_account`)
- `z.input<>` for form types to match zodResolver with default fields
- Named relations for Journal → FinAccount (4 FK refs)

## Contracting: Market Settings, Zones & Hotel Code Generation (Completed)
- **Date:** 2026-02-24
- **Commits:** `e3af823`, `72b885d`, `d4d45b5`

### Prisma Schema
- Added `Zone` model (id, companyId, cityId, name, code, active) mapped to `ct_zone`
  - Unique constraint: `[companyId, cityId, code]`
  - Relations: Company, City, Hotel[]
- Added `hotelCodePrefix String?` to Company model
- Added `zoneId String?` to Hotel model with relation and index

### Migration
- `20260224002510_add_zones_and_hotel_code_prefix`

### Validation Schemas
- `zoneCreateSchema` — cityId, name, code (1 char), active
- `zoneUpdateSchema` — partial of name, code, active
- Added `zoneId: z.string().nullish()` to `hotelCreateSchema`
- Changed `marketCreateSchema.countryIds` from `min(1)` to `default([])`

### tRPC Routers
- `contracting.destination.listZones` — zones for a city
- `contracting.destination.createZone` — with city ownership check
- `contracting.destination.updateZone` — with company ownership check
- `contracting.destination.deleteZone` — with linked hotels check
- `contracting.hotel.getNextHotelCode` — generates `{prefix}{cityCode}{zoneCode}{increment}`
- `settings.getCompanySettings` — added `hotelCodePrefix` to select
- `settings.updateCompanySettings` — added `hotelCodePrefix` to input

### UI Changes

#### Settings > Contracting Tab
- **Hotel Code Prefix** — single-letter input saved via `updateCompanySettings`
- **Market Predefinitions** — inline-editable CRUD grid (code, name, active, delete)
  - Same pattern as CitiesSection: Enter to save, Arrow keys to navigate

#### Contract Detail > Markets Tab
- Removed `createMarketMutation`, `showCreate`, `newMarket` state, `handleCreateMarket()`
- Removed entire "Create Market" dialog
- Empty state now shows: "No markets defined. Go to Settings > Contracting to create markets."
- "Add Market" button only shows when predefined markets exist

#### Destination Detail > Zones Section
- City selector buttons to toggle zone management per city
- `ZoneCityGrid` component — inline-editable grid (code = 1 uppercase letter, name, active, delete)

#### Hotel Create & Edit Pages
- Added Zone selector dropdown (filtered by selected city)
- Auto-generates hotel code via `getNextHotelCode` when zone is selected
- Code field becomes read-only (with `bg-muted font-mono` styling) when zone selected
- Cascade resets: Country → Destination → City → Zone

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed infinite `useEffect` loop in `MarketManagementSection` and `ZoneCityGrid` — changed dependency from `data ?? []` (new array ref each render) to raw query data with early return guard
